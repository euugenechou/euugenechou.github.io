I'm a PhD student (now candidate) at UC Santa Cruz working in the
[CRSS](https://crss.us/index.html) and advised by [Professor Darrell
Long](https://darrelllong.github.io) and [Professor Andi
Quinn](https://arquinn.github.io).

My [research](https://crss.ucsc.edu/person/eugenechou.html) aims to provide a
portable, non-intrusive, and efficient secure deletion solution for existing
systems and applications. My technical interests mostly lie in systems
programming, but I'm also a fan of programming language theory and reverse
engineering.

My non-technical interests are playing the piano/cello, transcribing music (that
I will probably never publish online), climbing, reading, and sleeping. I dream
of expanding this set of interests, but sadly find that I currently lack the
time management and/or energy to invest in the additional interests
meaningfully.
